<h1> My favorite song</h1>
<p>My favortie song is called ASTROTHUNDER by Travis Scott. The song is on his latest album called ASTROWORLD.</p>
<h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
<p>Seems like the life I need
Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Light the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I watch, repeat
Do it on repeat-repeat
Sins controllin' me, yeah
Angels, halos over me
I need blessings and my peace
You been out the streets, yeah
Wilin' out on me and my Gs
We been goin' for a week
Now you wanna peak, yeah
Hands up, why they tryna reach?
I can't even get that deep
Told you I don't teach 
Practice, oh, no, never preach. </p>
